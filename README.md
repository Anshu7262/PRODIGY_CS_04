PRODIGY_CS_04 â€“ Safe Educational Keylogger (Keystroke Recorder)

This project is a **safe, educational** demonstration of a simple keystroke recorder.  
It shows how keystrokes can be captured locally and is meant to help understand and prevent keylogging attacks.

**Important:**

> - This code is for **learning** only.
